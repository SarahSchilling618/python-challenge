Module 3 Challenge

This repostiory contains two python files, one which calculates the number of ballots casted in a small town election and determines the winner, and another that records and analyzes the financial records of a certain company, that also lists the months that had the biggest increases and decreases.
These scripts can be executed by opening GitBash in the folders that the original .cvs files that the data was taken from and entering the code I have provided.
This script was written to act on a specific Python workbook as an exercise at the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Bootcamp. 
I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment.
